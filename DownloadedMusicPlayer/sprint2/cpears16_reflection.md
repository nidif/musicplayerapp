# Sprint 2

Collins Pearson | GitHub ID: collinspearson | Downloaded Music Player

### What you planned to do
I planned to create the UI for the library tab, be able to catalog the songs, and be able to interpet a play command and send it to the player. I was also tasked with developing a UI for the settings tab.

### What you accomplished
I created the library tab 

### What you did not accomplish
I didn't develop a UI for the settings tab, and the library still needs a prompt for the filtering function.

### What problems you encountered
In terms of writing the code, since I was now doing front-end stuff instead of back-end algorithms and code, there was a bit more of a learning curve than there was for the last sprint. This definitely cost me a lot more time than I anticipated, and it highlighted a problem with how I managed my time for this sprint.
