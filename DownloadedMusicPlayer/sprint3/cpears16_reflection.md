# Sprint 3

Collins Pearson | GitHub ID: collinspearson | Downloaded Music Player

### What you planned to do
I planned to allow the creation of playlists, the display of playlists, and the ability to add songs to playlists.

### What you accomplished
I completed all three of those issues.

### What you did not accomplish
I will need to add an ability to remove songs from playlists, and possibly search for any bugs.

### What problems you encountered
I didn't really run into any problems this time around, now that I have more experience it went pretty smoothly, although it was time consuming.
