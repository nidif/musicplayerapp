(Give a bulleted list of the files in your github repo that you worked on. Give the full pathname.)

## What you accomplished
For the audio editor UI, I created sliders that will change the properties of the current audio being played. This was dome using the Slider component through react native. For the Audio manipulation library, I imported and implemented it using av-expo which allows you to do all the basic functions for audio manipulation such as play, pause, stop, change volume, playback speed, etc.
