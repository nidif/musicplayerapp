# Sprint 1

Collins Pearson | GitHub ID: collinspearson | Downloaded Music Player

### What you planned to do
I planned to create a Library for the music. This would list the songs and allow the user to sort and filter them.

### What you accomplished
I was able to write the backend functionality for displaying, sorting, and filtering the songs.

### What you did not accomplish
I was not able to display the actual buttons for each song. I needed the tab functionality complete to use it as a base to add the buttons, though we didn't have access to that yet.

### What problems you encountered
In terms of writing my code I didn't encounter any problems, that went pretty smoothly aside from having to adjust to a new language. The main issue was synchronizing everybody's work, we all did our work mostly independently, and when it came time to merge our work we weren't able to do it in time for the demo.
