This program uses Javascript with react native to create a simple app. 
The app displays:

-A title saying "Hello World Plus"

-2 labeled buttons that sends an alert once pressed

## How to run it

I followed this tutorial to get everything set up onto my computer. [Link] (https://docs.expo.dev/build/setup/) And then I followed this tutorial to get my server start to be able to run my code. [Link] (https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/create-a-project/)  I tested mine through the web browser. Also had to make sure Node.js was installed and up to date to get it to work.

## Technology used for Project

In our project, we plan to use Javascript with react native to create a mobile app that plays downloaded music.
