These files are used alongside React Native and Expo Go to display a simple tester app.

This app has a main landing screen with a title and a button that brings you to a secondary page with some test functions on it. It includes a counter that has buttons to increase and decrease the displayed value, a text input where you can put in a name for the app to greet you with, and it displays play and pause button assets for possible future use with the project.

### How to Run
- Install the latest version of Node.js
  - https://nodejs.org/en/download
  - Comes with npm/npx.
- Set up a React Native project
  - https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup
  - Can create own project following the above tutorial and transfer the files over. 
- Install Expo Go
  - On Google Play/App Store, displays app to your phone (tested with Android).
- Install React Navigation
  - https://reactnative.dev/docs/navigation
  - In same directory as App.js
  - npm  install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/native-stack
  - Allows for multiple pages in the app.

### Project Relevancy
Since the project is going to be a mobile app, and I am very new to app development, I just got some simple features figured out for the first few steps. The biggest step in getting any project going would be setting up the development environment, which I used React Native, Node.js, and Expo Go. Then, just getting familiar with some of the syntax, adding a landing page and another tester page, buttons, text input, and some sort of play/pause button, all of those were to get the basics down and pretty much every app has multiple pages and buttons and functions. I also tested out some of the audio playback modules for React Native, but ran into quite a few issues with them, so I plan to get that figured out by the next project update.
